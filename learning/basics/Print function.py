# Sure, here's a brief tutorial about the print() function in Python:
#
# In Python, print() is a built-in function that is used to display output on the console or terminal.
# It takes one or more arguments, which can be of any data type, and prints them to the console.
#
# The syntax of the print() function is:
import sys
from objects import objects

# print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

# *objects: One or more objects to be printed. If multiple objects are passed, they are separated by a space by default.
#     sep: The separator between the objects. It defaults to a space character.
#     end: The character to be printed at the end. It defaults to a newline character.
#     file: The file object to which the output is sent. It defaults to the console.
#     flush: A boolean value indicating whether the output should be flushed (True) or not (False)
#     . It defaults to False.
# Here are a few examples of using the print() function:

# Print a string
print("Hello, World!")
# Output:
# Hello, World!

# Print a variable
x = 42
print(x)
# Output:
# 42

# Print multiple variables
y = 3.14
print(x, y)
# Output:
# 42 3.14

# Print with a custom separator
print(x, y, sep=",")
# Output:
# 42,3.14

# Print without a newline character
print("Hello, ", end="")
print("World!")
# Output:
# Hello, World!

# You can also use the print() function with formatted strings using f-strings or format() function.

# f-string
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# Output:
# My name is Alice, and I am 30 years old.

# format() function
name = "Bob"
age = 25
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
# Output:
# My name is Bob, and I am 25 years old.

# That's it for this tutorial. The print() function is a simple but powerful tool in Python
# that can help you debug your code and display output to the console.
